## Title
üéâ Fix: Resolve Migration Scope to Singapore TCO integration issue

## Detailed Description

### Problem Resolved
Fixed critical integration issue where Singapore TCO was processing all 9 VMs instead of filtering out the 1 out-of-scope VM identified by Migration Scope analysis, causing inconsistent VM counts and incorrect cost calculations.

### Root Cause
- Frontend Migration Scope used comprehensive pattern matching including 'gateway' pattern
- Backend Singapore TCO re-ran Migration Scope analysis with different pattern matching (missing 'gateway')
- This caused erp-gateway-prod76 to be identified as out-of-scope in frontend but processed in backend

### Solution Implemented
- Enhanced Session Manager with Migration Scope result storage capabilities
- Modified Singapore TCO backend to use stored frontend analysis results instead of re-running analysis
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging and verification
- Implemented fallback logic for system resilience

### Key Changes
- **Backend**: Enhanced session storage, consistent VM filtering, comprehensive logging
- **Frontend**: Stores analysis results in backend after computation
- **Integration**: Cross-phase data consistency ensured
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation suite for maintenance

### Testing
- ‚úÖ Automated integration test script created and passed
- ‚úÖ Manual testing confirmed by user: "awesome! it worked! Finally!"
- ‚úÖ Console log analysis verified consistent VM filtering
- ‚úÖ End-to-end workflow validated

### Impact
- **Before**: Migration Scope (8 VMs) ‚â† Singapore TCO (9 VMs) ‚ùå
- **After**: Migration Scope (8 VMs) = Singapore TCO (8 VMs) ‚úÖ
- **Result**: Accurate cost calculations based on correct VM count

### Files Modified
- backend/models/core_models.py - Added migration_scope_analysis field
- backend/services/session_manager.py - Added storage/retrieval methods
- backend/routers/migration_scope.py - Auto-store analysis results

- frontend/src/contexts/SessionContext.tsx - Store results in backend
- frontend/src/components/phases/MigrationScopePhase.tsx - Enhanced logging
- frontend/src/pages/SingaporeTCOTest_scoped.tsx - Enhanced logging

### Documentation Added
- INTEGRATION_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md - Complete implementation details
- CONSOLE_LOG_ANALYSIS.md - Root cause analysis methodology
- FRONTEND_DEBUGGING_LOGS_ADDED.md - Debugging guide
- PROJECT_SUCCESS_SUMMARY.md - Complete project journey
- SINGAPORE_TCO_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md - Updated with integration fix
- test_integration_fix.py - Automated verification script

### Verification
User confirmed successful resolution: "awesome! it worked! Finally!"
All integration tests pass, system is fully operational.
