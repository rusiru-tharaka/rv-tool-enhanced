## üéØ **INVESTIGATION OBJECTIVES**

1. **Identify Root Causes** of cost calculation discrepancies
2. **Validate Pricing Data** for Singapore region
3. **Verify Calculation Logic** for Reserved Instance and On-Demand pricing
4. **Assess Data Flow** from RVTools input to CSV export
5. **Develop Fix Strategy** with comprehensive testing

## üìã **PHASE 1: DATA ANALYSIS & VALIDATION**

### **Step 1.1: Examine Source Data**
- [ ] Analyze RVTools_Sample_4 file structure and VM specifications
- [ ] Validate VM categorization (Production vs Non-Production)
- [ ] Check CPU, Memory, and Storage specifications
- [ ] Identify any data quality issues

### **Step 1.2: Analyze Exported CSV**
- [ ] Review vm-cost-estimates CSV for calculation patterns
- [ ] Identify specific VMs with discrepancies
- [ ] Compare Instance Cost vs expected calculations
- [ ] Analyze Storage Cost calculations
- [ ] Validate Total Cost summations

### **Step 1.3: Cross-Reference with Expected Values**
- [ ] Manual calculation verification for sample VMs
- [ ] Compare with AWS Pricing Calculator results
- [ ] Validate Singapore region pricing accuracy

---

## üîç **PHASE 2: TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION**

### **Step 2.1: Backend Service Analysis**
- [ ] Examine cost_estimates_service.py calculation logic
- [ ] Validate Reserved Instance pricing calculations
- [ ] Check On-Demand pricing with utilization factors
- [ ] Review Singapore region pricing data

### **Step 2.2: Pricing Service Validation**
- [ ] Test aws_pricing_service.py for Singapore region
- [ ] Validate local pricing cache accuracy
- [ ] Check API fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Verify Reserved Instance pricing formulas

### **Step 2.3: Instance Recommendation Analysis**
- [ ] Review VM-to-EC2 instance type mapping
- [ ] Validate instance sizing recommendations
- [ ] Check regional instance availability
- [ ] Analyze storage type recommendations

---

## üß™ **PHASE 3: SYSTEMATIC TESTING**

### **Step 3.1: Unit Testing**
- [ ] Test individual cost calculation functions
- [ ] Validate pricing lookup mechanisms
- [ ] Test utilization factor applications
- [ ] Verify currency and regional adjustments

### **Step 3.2: Integration Testing**
- [ ] End-to-end testing with RVTools_Sample_4
- [ ] Validate complete workflow from upload to export
- [ ] Test different TCO parameter combinations
- [ ] Verify CSV export accuracy

### **Step 3.3: Regression Testing**
- [ ] Compare with previous working calculations
- [ ] Test with other sample data sets
- [ ] Validate against known good results

---

## üîß **PHASE 4: FIX STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT**

### **Step 4.1: Root Cause Classification**
- [ ] Pricing data issues (incorrect rates)
- [ ] Calculation logic errors (formula problems)
- [ ] Data transformation issues (unit conversions)
- [ ] Regional configuration problems

### **Step 4.2: Fix Implementation Priority**
1. **Critical**: Incorrect pricing data or major calculation errors
2. **High**: Formula logic issues affecting accuracy
3. **Medium**: Data transformation or formatting issues
4. **Low**: Minor display or rounding discrepancies

### **Step 4.3: Validation Framework**
- [ ] Create test cases for each identified issue
- [ ] Implement automated validation checks
- [ ] Establish baseline accuracy metrics
- [ ] Create regression test suite
